# Tooltip Component

This repository contains a frontend app that implements a tooltip component with dynamic positioning, style, and text. The app is built using React.js and Next.js, and it includes a live preview of the tooltip being rendered.

## Problem Statement

In-app nudges provide non-intrusive guides for various features of a mobile app. The goal of this project is to build a tooltip component that can be used to draw attention to a specific element on the screen. The tooltip should support setting the target element, position (top/right/bottom/left), style, and text dynamically. Additionally, it should provide a real-time preview of a mobile screen with button elements that act as the target elements for the tooltip.

## Instructions

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
* Navigate to the project directory: cd custom-tooltip
* Install the dependencies: npm install
* Start the development server: npm run dev
* Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can use the tooltip component to configure and preview tooltips with different settings. The following features are available:

* Set the target element: You can select a button element on the mobile screen as the target for the tooltip.

* Choose the position: Specify the position of the tooltip relative to the target element (top/right/bottom/left).

* Customize the style: Adjust the styling of the tooltip, including background color, text color, and font size.

* Enter the tooltip text: Provide the text content that will be displayed in the tooltip.


The tooltip component is built and positioned without the use of any additional libraries. It leverages the capabilities of React.js and Next.js to achieve the desired functionality.

### Persistence

The data used to build the tooltips is persistent. This means that any tooltips you create and configure will be saved and retained even if you close and reopen the app. You can revisit the app at any time, and your previous tooltips will be loaded and displayed.
